# isThisPong is a Lua program that uses the LOVE 2D framework and simulates a Pong game with a litle twist
# For this game I am using Visual Studio Code and the LOVE extension on it to make it run, after these installed you do not need anything specific to make it work properly
# The idea of this game is that you score 10 goals on each boss to defeat it
# Each boss will have a different special move that will be unlocked whenever you reach the boss "threshold point"
# After defeating each boss the player will acquire the boss's special ability and can use to defeat the next one
# There is also a 2 players mode which is not really the focus of the game but it is available for versatility
